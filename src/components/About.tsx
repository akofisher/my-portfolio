        Hi, I’m Akaki Lekveishvili — a Front-end Developer specializing in React
        Native and ReactJS with over four years of experience building
        production-ready web and mobile applications. I focus on creating clean,
        scalable architectures using modern best practices, reusable components,
        optimized performance, and smooth user experiences.
        <br />
        <br />
        I’ve built complete booking systems, e-commerce platforms, clinic
        software, and admin dashboards — taking projects from zero to production
        while ensuring strong architecture, reliable API integrations, and
        maintainable codebases.
        <br />
        <br />
        My expertise includes JavaScript, TypeScript, ReactJS, React Native,
        Redux Toolkit, RTK Query, TailwindCSS, Formik, Axios, WebSocket, Git,
        and modern frontend tooling. I am comfortable owning projects
        end-to-end, improving existing applications, or developing new ones from
        scratch.
        <br />
        <br />
        With a strong problem-solving mindset and a focus on product quality, I
        aim to deliver high-performance, user-friendly, and scalable
        applications that bring real value to teams and users.
